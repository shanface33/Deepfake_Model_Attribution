# Deepfake_Model_Attribution
Codes and dataset (DFDM) for Face-swapped Deepfakes Model Attribution


We created a new dataset, named DFDM, with 6,450 Deepfake videos generated by different Autoencoder models. Specifically, five widely-used models with variations in encoder, decoder, intermediate layer, and input resolution, respectively, have been selected to generate Deepfakes based on the same input. 

The dataset will be released in March, 2022.
